# webcrypto-tests
Demonstrate potential bugs in webcrypto API implementations of some Browsers.

This is **NOT** a place to file issues against browsers.  

The idea is to link to code exhibiting a particular problem when filing an issue against a Browser. 
At the moment this is about issues I ran into when working on related code. 
It is not intended to become a central resource about web crypto implementation issues. 

I don't indent to engage in discussing issues or accept PRs here.
